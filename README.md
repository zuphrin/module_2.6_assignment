# Module 2.6 Assignment
## Project: Atomic Root-mean-square Deviation (RMSD) Calculation for Assessing Structural Integrity in Molecular Dynamics Simulations of DNA
### Objective:
This project involved developing a simple script to analyze RMSD data from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of DNA. The script reads RMSD data from plain text files using pandas. The primary output is a composite plot showcasing time series and distribution data for all five replicate simulations.
